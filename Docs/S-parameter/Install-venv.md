# Install venv
`venv` is a virtual environment for python.
It is prepared by
```
python3 -m venv /path/to/venv
```
For example, `/path/to/venv` is replaced with `.`. In this case,
a virtual environment is created in the current directory.
In the venv directory, there are some of `Unix` standard directories,
```
bin,
include,
lib,
share.
```
You can start python3 by `bin/python3`.
